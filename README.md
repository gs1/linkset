# GS1 Digital Link linkset

This is a repository where we can play around with the format of the linkset returned from
any GS1 Digital Link resolver that makes use of the [linkset IETF Internet Draft](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpapi-linkset-03).

# Linkset visualization 
The [linksetVisualization library](https://github.com/gs1/linkset/blob/master/gs1LinksetViz.js) renders a linkset as HTML. A set of [basic CSS rules](https://github.com/gs1/linkset/blob/master/gs1LinksetViz.css) is also provided as well as a [demo](https://gs1.github.io/linkset/)
