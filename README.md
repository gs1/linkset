# GS1 Digital Link 1.2 linkset
Please note that this should be treated as work in progress as the 1.2 standard has not yet been ratified.

This is a repository where we can play around with the format of the linkset returned from
a GS1 Digital Link 1.2 resolver and based on the [linkset IETF Internet Draft](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilde-linkset-07).

# Linkset visualization 
The [linksetVisualization library](https://github.com/gs1/linkset/blob/master/gs1LinksetViz.js) renders a linkset as HTML. A set of [basic CSS rules](https://github.com/gs1/linkset/blob/master/gs1LinksetViz.css) is also provided as well as a [demo](https://gs1.github.io/linkset/)
